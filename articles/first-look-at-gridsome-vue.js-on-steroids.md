#### What is Gridsome?

Gridsome is a _Static-Site-Generator_ for **Vue.JS,** which is heavily inspired by Gatsby and Nuxt.JS. Websites made with Gridsome are fast by default as they are Vue powered SPA's, and data layer is handled by _GraphQL_, which is a great and very easy tool to collect data almost from anywhere like WordPress, Any API's, .md files, or even Google Spreadsheet and turn them into static sites.

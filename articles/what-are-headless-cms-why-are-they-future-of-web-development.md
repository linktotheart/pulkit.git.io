description: Headless CMS — a body without head

---
The logic of traditional CMS combines the back-end and front-end parts of one system. In this case, the content turns out to be associated with specific technologies, architecture and patterns of the client-server application.

Headless CMS is a fundamentally different management system. Typically, it is only responsible for generic content that can be used on all platforms. The backend **(“body”)**with this approach is not associated with the frontend **(“head”)**.

The logic of Headless CMS is such that different heads can be attached to the “body” if necessary. This allows you to use a single backend to manage a site (or sites) and a mobile application, as well as automate the distribution of content across all available sites and devices.

As a result, the resources spent on web development are minimized. And the management of different platforms is carried out centrally from a single interface, which is convenient. At the same time, the content is flexibly configured for each individual channel.

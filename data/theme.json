I started drawing and designing from a young age and most of my design skills and knowledge are self-taught. I got into programming when I was introduced to web programming during high school. It fascinated me and it hooked me on, so I decided to pursue this career. Even though I took the path of becoming a programmer, my strong and innate talent in arts and design persisted. Consequently, I taught myself about software design patterns. Combining the state of the art and my programming knowledge, I am able to build a professional and interactive websites. I will not stick around on just doing Front End development projects. My goal is to take it to the next level of becoming a Full Stack Developer and become one of the world's top designers, so now, I am working towards it. I have prepared myself to accept the challenges into this ever changing world and I will try my very best to achieve my dreams and goals.",
